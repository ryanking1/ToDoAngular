1. We use npm install and bower install to install our dependencies.
2. Then we install any global packages that we need, which aren't tracked by our manifest files, such as gulp, bower, sass, typescript, and our text editor's typescript packages.
3. Then we can build our whole project with gulp build.
4. And run it with: gulp serve.
